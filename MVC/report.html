                <h3>General Design Concepts</h3>
                <p>The page design can have a significant impact on the success of our communication, on it's usability
                    and persuasiveness.</p>
                <p>That is why we will try to focus on reader-centered pages, facilitating the understanding of
                    information & the ability to find it with ease.</p>
            </section>

                <section>
                    <h4>Source Code</h4>
                    <p>The tool we chose to use for code hosting is
                        <span typeof="schema:WebSite">
                            <span property="schema:name">Github</span>
                            <meta property="schema:url" content="https://github.com/">
                        </span>
                        .
                    </p>
                    <p>We have created a public repository at:
                        <span typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode">
                            <span property="schema:name"><a href="https://github.com/beatricedia/SeAN">SeAN</a></span>
                            <meta property="schema:codeRepository" content="https://github.com/beatricedia/SeAN">
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>And we will be using the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">suggested</a>
                        workflow for our features:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Creating a new branch for the feature.</li>
                        <li>Making as many commits as necessary.</li>
                        <li>Merging the new branch into the main one.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Team Coordination</h4>
                    <p>We have decided to use
                        <span typeof="schema:WebSite">
                            <span property="schema:name">Trello</span>
                            <meta property="schema:url" content="https://trello.com/">
                        </span>
                        for our Project Tracking Software.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our workflow aim is to be agile (with a twist), thus our boards we have the following layout:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To do</li>
                        <li>In progress</li>
                        <li>Done</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finally, as a communicating hub for our team, we chose
                        <span typeof="schema:WebSite">
                            <span property="schema:name">facebook</span>
                            <meta property="schema:url" content="https://www.facebook.com/">
                        </span>
                        .
                    </p>
                    <p>We improved it by integrating Trello & Github into it.</p>

                <h3>How we began...</h3>
                <p>We started by realising the front-end part. We chose the colors and we decided how many pages we will have. At first we decided to make 5 pages: news, register, login, adding an allergy and suggestions.</p> 
                <p>We then split which of us makes what pages and we proceeded in developing them.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section>
                <h3>Midway struggle...</h3>
                <p>We had to decide on how we are going to realise the notifications (what type of notifications and how we would save the user choices). At first we were thinking of a pop-up with options but we realised that we need one more page where users can select what allergies they have and select what option of notification they want to recive.</p>
                <p>We decided to have an admin who will give the approvel to add to the news an allergy suggested by the user by clicking on a button that appears in front-end (which only he can see).</p>
                <p>Also added a feedback form to see our users impressions about our site.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>In the end...</h3>
                <p>The workflow is ready. We have HTML and PDF statistics which can be downloaded for each of the allergy we have in our database. Those are displayed in allergy page and also on the news page. We added an extra HTML or PDF report about our application which include statistics about how many users from a specific gender have a specific allergy.</p>
                <p>The notifications are popping when you acces the website (logged in) if something new is added.</p>
                <p>Enjoy!</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Testing...</h3>
                <p>We all did our fair share of testing while we were developing our parts, and after we were pleased with what we’ve done, we then commited the changes to our github repository ( we all had a branch ) and each of us could’ve test again the parts our team members did.</p>
