        <h2>Pollen allergy</h2>
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Allergic symptoms tend to be particularly intense on cool days when the wind rises and 
		the pollen is transported through the air. On rainy days, on the other hand, there is a decrease in the amount of pollen in
		air. Allergy manifestations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>rhinorrhoea, eyes tearing</li>
          <li>sneezing</li>
          <li>cough</li>
          <li>itching of the nose and eyes</li>
          <li>swelling of the eyes.</li>
        </ul>      
        <h3>Treatment </h3>
        <p>Treatments for spring allergies include many non-prescription drugs.
		These drugs are effective in most cases and include: </p>
		<ul>
          <li> antihistamines - relieves allergy symptoms by lowering histamine levels </li>
          <li> decongestants - helps relieve nasal passages and relieve congestion and inflammation </li>  
		  <li> nasal sprays with cromolyn sodium - can help prevent seasonal allergic rhinitis by limiting
		  histamine production before it triggers allergic symptoms </li>
		  <li> eye drops - to relieve itching and eye lacrimation.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>
        Even if you can purchase these medicines without a prescription, it is advisable to talk with
		your doctor before using them to make sure you are being treated appropriately and safely.
		Some antihistamines may cause the feeling of being sleepy (so you need to be careful when
		when you take them during the day). Do not use antihistamines and decongestants released without prescription
		medical, more than a few days without first talking to your doctor. </p>
